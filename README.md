This is a tool to help you find your local council/local authority. 

It uses the list of local authorities from <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/ms-uk-local-authorities">the Home Office's modern slavery app.</a>

I googled for all of the coronavirus pages, please forgive me and raise a github issue if it's incorrect. 

This is built with preact-cli.
